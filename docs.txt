Listeners Documentation

A listener file consists of Headers, Conditions, and Actions.

File Structure

[TYPE listener]:
[if {variable} operator "value"]:
    [action]

1. Listener Types (Headers)

Defines which event the bot monitors.

[CHAT listener]:
Listens to standard chat messages.

[BOSSBAR listener]:
Listens to text inside the Boss Bar.

[ACTIONBAR listener]:

2. Conditions

Defines when the actions should trigger.

Format: [if {placeholder} operator "value"]:

Available Placeholders

{message} - The full raw message received from the server.

{player} - The name of the player who sent the message (Chat only).

{playermsg} - The message content sent by a player (Chat only).

3. Actions

Actions must be indented (using spaces or tabs) under a condition. An action is any command supported by the bot's script engine.

5. Technical Notes

Indentation: Actions must be indented (at least 4 spaces or 1 tab) under the [if ...]: line, otherwise they will be ignored.

Comments: Lines starting with # or empty lines are ignored.

Code Extraction: The {code} placeholder automatically looks for a sequence of 5 to 10 alphanumeric characters (A-Z, 0-9) in the message. If your action uses {code} but no code is found in the message, the action is skipped.
